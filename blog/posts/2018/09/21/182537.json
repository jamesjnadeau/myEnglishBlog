<p>Wishlist item: I wish it were possible to write a driver for GitHub that would teach it how to display formats it doesn't know about, like "OPML" and "RSS". I write my development notes in OPML, and would like to have them be directly readable in GitHub. OPML has been stable for 18 years and RSS for 16. I think it would be safe to support them now. And this raises a question, can there be a process for vetting the code and adding it to the native capabilities of GitHub? I think most of the expertise in these formats exists outside their company. Are we ready for this kind of collaboration?</p>
